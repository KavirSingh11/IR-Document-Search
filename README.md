# IR-Document-Search
This program is a search app that takes a query from the user and finds all relevant documents to the query in the CACM test document set. The first step to this is it generates a dictionary of all terms in the document set with how frequent the terms are, and it generates a postings list which stores information on how often the term appears in each specific document it appears in.

Using these values inverse document frequency values are assigned using the formula log(Number of Documents/Term Frequency)

Next the app asks for either the user if they want to enter a query or start an evaluation, in the event of a query, the string is split into an array and each term in the query is given a term-frequency value using the formula 1+log(frequency of term). Then a weight vector is generated by multiplying these Tf values with the corresponding IDF values generated in the last step giving a weight value for the term. Next similarty values are calculated by generating these same weight vectors for every document in the test document set, these weight vectors are then used with the query weight vectors using the dot product between the query vector and the document vector divided by the normalization of both vectors multiplied by each other, this formula outputs the final similarty score. The top 10 highest similarity scores are then presented to the user with the document number, document title, and authors.

The evaluation is done using preset queries with known relevant documents, each query is treated in the same way as before, except once the search is done each of the outputs for the queries is evaluated with the expected outcome, the number of hits is used to calculate the mean average precision and the R-precision.
